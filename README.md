# Pyrmenum

A Python-based filesystem permissions enumerator. The idea here is that with a given principle (user, group, etc.), you can visualize the access that principle has on the file system.

## Who the heck cares?
- 🖨️ Sysadmins auditing their filesystems for permissions creep.
- 👨🏽‍💻 Penetration testers enumerating filesystems following exploitation.
- 🕺🏼 Anyone else who may want to know who can read/write what!
